# A Hardhat React NFT Collectible Project

Built While In Dapp University Mentorship Program

This project demonstrates an NFT use case, using Inheritance from Open Zeppelin Contracts, inside of a Hardhat/React.js framework.

## Getting Started

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
GAS_REPORT=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js

# Using the dApp on Sepolia Testnet

1. Ensure you have MetaMask installed and set up with a Sepolia testnet account.

2. Get some Sepolia ETH from a faucet if you don't have any.

3. Connect your MetaMask to the Sepolia testnet.

4. Navigate to the dApp's URL in your web browser.

5. Connect your MetaMask wallet to the dApp when prompted.

6. You can now interact with the NFT contract on the Sepolia testnet:
   - View available NFTs
   - Mint new NFTs (ensure you have enough Sepolia ETH)
   - View your owned NFTs

Note: Always ensure you're connected to the Sepolia testnet in MetaMask when using this dApp.
```
